UniFlash vintage laptop/motherbard BIOS flasher<br>
Not to be confused with the TI Uniflash software https://www.ti.com/tool/download/UNIFLASH which serves other purposes.

Fork based on code originally from:<br>
- UniFlash 1.40 by Rainbow Software (http://www.uniflash.org)<br>

Updated with code from:<br>
-  UniFlash 2.00.SPI.RC03 by http://www.rom.by/book/Uniflash<br>
-  mirrored at https://soggi.org/motherboards/bios-update-flash-utilities.htm<br>

Then updated with my code for Toshiba Satellite S1800-S100/S20X flash BIOS.
